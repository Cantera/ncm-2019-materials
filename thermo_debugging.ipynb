    "These warnings are part of a validation check that Cantera does to make sure the thermodynamics data are consistent. In the standard NASA 14-coefficient polynomial form, the thermodynamics data are defined as two five coefficient polynomials (plus two other constants) over two temperature ranges. This is the form used for CHEMKIN files. The discontinuities occur when either the slope or the value of the thermodynamic functions ($c_p/R$, $h/(RT)$, or $s/R$) has a discontinuity at the mid-point temperature. Most commonly, one or more the discontinuities are due to incorrectly fit parameters, but they can also be caused by other means. Let's investigate."
