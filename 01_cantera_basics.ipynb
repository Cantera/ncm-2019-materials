    "This leads to one of the most confusing parts of Jupyter Notebooks - they are non-linear. Since the execution of any cell modifies the state of the kernel, it can be confusing to keep track of the state of a variable as you move around in the Notebook. For instance, executing a cell at the bottom of a Notebook that changes the value of a variable `a`, then moving to the top of the Notebook and running a cell that relies on `a` will work fine, but can lead to difficult to diagnose behavior. When in doubt, Restarting the kernel erases all of the stored state and let's you start from a fresh slate."

    "You might be wondering how `equilibrate` works. (Then again, you might not.) Method `equilibrate` invokes Cantera's chemical equilibrium solver, which uses an element potential method. The element potential method is one of a class of equivalent *nonstoichiometric* methods that all have the characteristic that the probelm reduces to solving a set of $M$ nonlinear algebraic equations, where $M$ is the number of elements (not species). The so-called *stoichiometric* methods, on the other hand (including the Gibbs minimization), require solving $K$ nonlinear equations, where $K$ is the number of species (usually $K >> M$). See Smith and Missen's \"Chemical Reaction Equilibrium Analysis\" for more information on the various algorithms and their characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cantera uses a damped Newton method to solve these equations, and does a few other things to generate a good starting guess and to produce a reasonably robust algorithm. If you want to know more about the details, look at the on-line documentated source code of Cantera C++ class [`ChemEquil.h`](https://cantera.org/documentation/docs-2.4/doxygen/html/d4/dd4/ChemEquil_8h.html)."
